# Zonals Stats and Volume Extractions Tools

Welcome - This is the start point to access geospatial tools that have been developed by the USDA / ARS Forage and Range Research Lab in Logan Utah to process imagery collected using unmanned aerial vehicles - aka "drones".

These tools will help you:

* Generate a suite of vegetation indices (i.e. NDVI, RVI, NDRE, Greenness) from regular Red Green Blue RGB imagery as well as multispectral datasets
* Compute "cut/fill" volumes from digital surface models DSM
* Generate circular or rectangular buffers (areas of interest AOI) around point geometries
* Use polygon geometries (i.e. agricultural plots boundaries) to extract zonal statistics
* Save the vegetation indices as output multilayer rasters that can be used for predictive modeling purposes
